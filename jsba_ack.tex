First of all, I would like to thank my research supervisors, Dr. Lena Wiese and Prof. Dr. Ulrich Sax, for their assistance and dedicated involvement in all steps 
throughout the evolution and writing of my thesis. I am very grateful for your support and the inspiring conversations with you.

Furthermore, I appreciate the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen for provision of the cloud server for implementing and testing the
developed approaches. 

Last but not the least, I express gratitude to all others who supported me with encouragement and patience, especially, my family and partner supporting me 
throughout this venture.
