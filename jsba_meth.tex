\subsection{Apache Ignite}
\label{sec:meth_ign}

\citetalias{Ignite} is desribed as a "memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming
workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale" (\citetalias{Ignite}, see also \url{https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs} for the full
documentation).
Its main features are distributed in-memory storage as well as optionally persistent storage of data on the disk that can be treated as a distributed, join
supporting SQL database or as a distributed key-value in-memory data grid. There are a lot more features provided by \citetalias{Ignite} that are not of
relevance here and will be left out because of that reason, thus, in the following there will be a focus on the distributed SQL database part.
Furthermore, the implementation will be based on a pure in-memory storage where all the data will be stored entirely in the RAM without any persistent 
storage of the data due to performance issues. The of \citetalias{Ignite} provided SQL-capable in-memory DDB instances can be spread across the network 
via a set of interconnected Ignite nodes that form a so-called \emph{cluster}. Each node of the cluster can be hosted by a different physical machine 
in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but there can be multiple nodes on the same machine, too. Even multiple nodes running in the same virtual machine are
possible. With the underlying Client-Server architecture, a node can be either a server node, which is responsible for storing and processing data, or a
client node that is able to connect remotely to the cluster of server nodes and compute or query from the client side. Figure~\ref{fig:ign_cluster} shows
a sample cluster consisting of 6 server nodes which are responsible for computations and storing data. This servers can be accessed remotely from clients
that can connect to the cluster via an programming language API (e.g. Java), via a JDBC or ODBC connection or via a REST-API (see documentation for
details).

\subsubsection{Partitioning and Replication}
\label{sec:meth_ign_panre}
The server nodes of an Ignite cluster store some certain data of the whole data set depending on the fragmentation (partitioning, cf.
Section~\ref{sec:theo_ddb_frag}) and replication (cf. Section~\ref{sec:theo_ddb_repl}). The fragmentation and replication is always defined for relations,
i.e. the tables of the relational DDB. For example, under full replication each server would store the total data of the relation and in the partitioned 
mode the relation is partitioned and each server is then responsible for only a subset of the data. It is also possible to have partitioning and 
replication at the same time if the partitions of the data are stored on more than one server such that each partition of the data is stored on one 
server as primary partition and on the other servers as backup copies for higher availability and data resiliency in case of server node failures. 
In replicated mode, a balancing of the data load is achieved by a partitioning of the data of the relation with hash functions into subsets of nearly 
equal size that are dispersed equally among all nodes of the cluster to exploit as much memory as possible on all nodes. However, even more memory is
available if there is no replication of the data in form of redundant copies that would consume additional parts of the total available memory. 

The partitioning is always a horizontal fragmentation of the data but the way how this is computed is only syntactically defined with hash functions, thus,
there are no explicit selection conditions on a certain attribute of the relation that represent a horizontal fragment as described in the
Section~\ref{sec:theo_ddb_frag}, and the assignment of tuples to the partitions of the relation they belong to is done rather arbitrarily. The only way to
influence and change this assignment of a tuple to a partition is via an affinity function, which is explained in the following section.



\subsubsection{Affinity Collocation and Distributed Joins}
\label{sec:meth_ign_affc}

One important concept of \citetalias{Ignite} is the collocation of data with data that corresponds to the concept of a derived horizontal fragmentation 
(cf. Section~\ref{sec:theo_ddb_frag}). Hereby, data that is accessed together, e.g. because it is joined via a common attribute or a foreign key reference,
is also stored together on the same server which improves the data locality~\citep{Wiese2014} and allows for collocated distributed joins that benefit from
this improvement in the data locality as the costly data transfer of data, which is required to obtain an answer to a query, across the network is 
avoided. This \emph{affinity collocation} is internally defined for the key-value store underlying the relational SQL database ensuring that all entries 
of collocated tables where the affinity keys match are stored on the same server. The usage is restricted to a single affinity key definition per 
relation. With this restriction, there can not be a collocation of three or more relations that could be joined via a chain of join conditions where the
joining attributes, that would form a possible affinity key, are different. An affinity key can be the same as the primary key of the relation or an 
attribute of a composite primary key of the relation. The concept of affinity collocation strongly corresponds to the primary and derived horizontal
fragmentation of relations (cf. Section~\ref{sec:theo_ddb_frag}), i.e. the derived fragmentation also ensures that tuples from the derived horizontal 
fragments are located at the same server where also the tuples reside with which they can and will be joined in SQL queries.

Joins between partitioned relations require for collocation of the data that is about to be joined. Otherwise, a non-collocated distributed join has to be
performed or the result set will be incomplete as the non-collocated parts of the data can not be joined locally by the nodes. If all the joined relations
in the SQL query are collocated, the query can be evaluated locally by each node, because all the data they need to compute a correct result set regarding 
their portion of the whole data in the cluster is available, i.e. stored by themselves. The query execution for this case is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:ign_collocated} where the query $Q$ is sent from the client to each server node which executes the query $Q$ locally 
and returns the result set $R_i$ to the query according to its stored data set. The final result set is the accumulation of the result sets $R_1+R_2+R_3$
which is meant as union of the result sets. This computation of the result set as union of locally obtained result sets is very similar to the localization
program \cite[p.~199]{Ozsu1991} as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:theo_dqp_decomp} where the union of all the fragments of certain relations is used to
rewrite the query in order to execute it in a distributed fashion.  
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,keepaspectratio=true]{img/2af89cf-Collocated_sql_queries.png}
    \caption{Collocated SQL Query. Source: Picture 1, \protect\url{https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/distributed-joins} (Accessed 16th Feb 2019)}
    \label{fig:ign_collocated}
\end{figure}

On the other side, non-collocated joins require for additional communication and data transfer between the nodes of the cluster as the data, that is needed
for a join or another computation, is not locally present, thus, the nodes have to sent requests for the data to other nodes to complete their result set 
computations appropriately. This additional data transfer implies a bad efficiency of query execution as it depends on the transmission duration of
probably bigger data sets between the nodes. Furthermore, this causes additional load on the network that can decrease the performance of other tasks or
operations. Non-collocated joins must be enabled explicitly in \citetalias{Ignite} to enforce the distributed answering with data transfer across the
cluster if necessary. If not enabled explicitly, the query will be executed in a collocated manner which, in general, leads to incomplete result sets due
to the unavailable locality of required data. The general flow of a query execution of a non-collocated, distributed query is sketched in
Figure~\ref{fig:ign_noncoll}. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,keepaspectratio=true]{img/95f09db-Non_collocated_sql_queries.png}

    \label{fig:ign_noncoll}
\end{figure}
 
In comparison to Figure~\ref{fig:ign_collocated}, the additional data transfer, that might occur in relation to the non-collocated query, is depicted as
potential data movement $D(Q)$ in a peer-to-peer fashion between all pairs of nodes. However, the data request of a node can be sent as a unicast request 
to a certain node of the cluster (peer-to-peer communication) or as a broadcast request to all other nodes. This decision depends on whether the 
requesting node can identify the exact location of the data, i.e. if it is a join on a primary or affinity key, or if it has to request the missing data
from all other nodes otherwise. 

 
 
\subsection{Clustering-based Fragmentation}
\label{sec:meth_cbfr}

The \emph{clustering-based fragmentation} \citep{Wiese2014} is a horizontal fragmentation strategy that, on the one hand, enables fragmentation regarding 
a similarity metric which allows for a more semantic partitioning of the data set, and, on the other hand, supports the \emph{similarity-based query
answering} (cf. Section~\ref{sec:meth_sbqa}), and the, for example in case of a query failure, desired \emph{flexible query answering} 
(cf. Section~\ref{sec:meth_fqa}). The underlying clustering is computed based on an approximation algorithm \citep{Gonzales1985} with respect to all 
values that can occur for a chosen \emph{relaxation attribute} of the relation, the \emph{active domain} as defined in the following (according to
Definition 2 in \cite{Wiese2014}).

\begin{definition}
Given a relaxation attribute $A$ and a relation instance $R$ (set of tuples), let $\pi_A(R)$ denote the \emph{active domain} of the relaxation attribute
$A$ of the relation $R$.
\end{definition}

With the chosen relaxation attribute $A$ of a relation $R$ and a pairwise similarity $sim(a, b)$, $\pi_A(R) \times \pi_A(R) \to \mathbb{R}$, defined  
for pairs of elements from the active domain $\pi_A(R)$and according to the formal mathmatical definition of a metric, a clustering in terms of a 
partitioning of the active domain into disjunctive subsets can be obtained by evaluating the similarities and assigning the elements to the clusters in
a such way that the pairwise intracluster similarity is always at least as big as the pairwise intercluster similarity. This means that any element has 
a higher similarity to elements of the same cluster than compared to elements from other clusters, thus, a cluster describes rather similar elements. 
An appropriate criterion for determining how "similar" two elements have to be to belong to the same cluster is required and can be defined as a threshold
parameter $\alpha$ and a \emph{head} element representing the cluster that enforce a minimal intracluster similarity \cite{Gonzales1985}. Under this
restriction, for any element $a$ of a cluster, the corresponding $head$ element of this cluster and a given threshold $\alpha$ holds that 
$sim(a,head) \geq \alpha$. The behavior of the clustering procedure when scaling the threshold parameter is analyzed in Section. \todo[inline]{Ref alpha scaling}

The different clusters contained in the clustering can be used to obtain a horizontal fragmentation of a relation by partitioning the relation along the 
disjunctive subsets of elements from the active domain with respect to the relaxation attribute. Each cluster corresponds to one horizontal fragment where
the tuples are mapped to a fragment based on the membership of the relaxation attribute's value in the tuple to the subset of elements in a cluster. 

\begin{exmp}
\label{sec:meth_cbfr_exmp}
Consider the clustering $C=\{c_1, c_2, c_3\}$ where $c_1=\{"Car","Bus","Truck"\}$, $c_2=\{"Ferry","Row boat","Speedboat"\}$ and $c_3=\{"Airplane", 
"Glider","Helicopter"\}$. The clustering obviously clusters a set of vehicle describing terms according to the categories of their area of usage, which 
are land, sea and air, respectively, which indicates that different aircrafts are more similar than for example a boat and an airplane are. To this
clustering, consider the relation $Products$ with the relaxation attribute $Category$ as shown in Table~\ref{tab:cbfr_products}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Name & Category & Price \\
        \hline
        XFast & Car & 50.000€ \\
        Rowy & Row boat & 999€ \\
        UFO-9 & Airplane & 100.000.000€ \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Relation $Products$ describing different vehicles that are sold by a company}
    \label{tab:cbfr_products}
\end{table}

The clustering-based, horizontal fragmentation of the relation $Products$ consists of three fragments, $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$, where fragment $F_i$
includes all the tuples from the relation $Products$ that are categorized by a term that belongs to the cluster $c_i$, i.e. the first fragment contains
the tuple of the car named "XFast", the second fragment contains the tuple of the row boat named "Rowy", etc., as illustrated by
Table~\ref{tab:cbfr_frags}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \hspace*{\fill}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Name & Cat. & Price \\
        \hline
        XFast & Car & 50k€ \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \hline

        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \hline

    \hfill
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Name & Cat. & Price\\
        \hline
        UFO-9 & Airplane & 100B€ \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \hspace*{\fill}
    \caption{Clustering-based, horizontal fragments fragments $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$ (from left to right) of relation $Products$ 
            (Table~\ref{tab:cbfr_products})}

\end{table}

\end{exmp}



The formal definition can be found in \cite{Wiese2014}.
